# CR-Wikipedia
Project as a part of the Natural Language course about Coreference Resolution in Wikipedia.
The Coreference resolution exploit the semantic network BabelNet and the disambiguation system BabelFy.

Unfortuately, since it is a research project it can't be possible to run the code.
For more info contact me.
